# Dobble
Clone of the Dobble Card Game

It uses the new @App architecture, it's localized to Portuguese, and allows multiplayer mode.

The original

It's based on a card game that uses some crazy mathematics called Projective planes, and you can get more info about it [here]( https://www.petercollingridge.co.uk/blog/mathematics-toys-and-games/dobble/)
